## what does it do
Because the 100 days of code, I was trying to add what I typically do to my learning and coding journey.  My MongoDB cluster for old MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node) Applications was deleted because of lack of use.  I need to update the apps and create new data collections.  

I also played with some Machine Learning concepts in TensorFlow to add to the apps later and considered the addition of Python in these changes.
