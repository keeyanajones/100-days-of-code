### Day 0: October 6, 2022 Thursday (Preparing)
**Today's Progress**: I updated my tools (VSCode and Github Desktop) and started planning what I wanted to learn or improve.  I followed and subscribed to the social media accounts related to the challenge.  I also decided on a format for the work to be displayed. I updated my discord server and looked at how others post progress.   

**Thoughts:** I created a task list, updated Trello, my schedule, and overall I feel excited and ready to get started.  I do feel like I am not really a noob because I code more than an hour daily but I only sync my changes once a month for my website. I am a little concerned about how this will turn out because unlike most, my aim is not to teach Python, get a million followers, or be a fancy doctor scientist of the computer. My aim is to do what I already do but share it to inspire people who are like me.      

### Day 1: October 7, 2022 Friday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many projects, exercises, and task on my Trello I need to get done.

**Thoughts** I've fallen behind on my a few of my task, and I plan on combining task to get caught up on task and working on the challenge.  I need to sync my github everyday.

### Day 2: October 8, 2022 Saturday

**Today's Progress**: I'm still working on my website updates, learned some ai fundamentals,  working on MongoDB cluster, and Machine Learning with python and Tensorflow.

**Thoughts** I thought this was going to be easier than this.  I didn't realize how messy this was making my schedule but I'm too prideful to quit. I need to sync my github everyday but I still keep forgetting and I can't get vscode to do it right.

### Day 3: October 9, 2022 Sunday

**Today's Progress**: I've learned a lot now and see how I might be able to add more AI to some of my projects. Coding in Python again, so I had to update everything and get my tensorflow together. Working on the FreeCodeCamp Course for ml with python.   

**Thoughts** I've fallen behind on my everything and haven't played any games. Its alot though and I'm already behind in my posting. 

### Day 4: October 10, 2022 Monday

**Today's Progress**: I'm still working my way through the ML with python course and trying tensorflow.  Organizing my code for new repository.    

**Thoughts** I also started working on my projects, exercises, and task on my Trello that needed to get done. I'm slowly getting caught up.  Next time I try to add something else to my schedule I will think about it more.

### Day 5: October 11, 2022 Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I finished the ML with Python course, upload my python practice code, and make some changes to my website.

**Thoughts** I am caught up and need to find a better way to keep on schedule.  I have a few ideas.  


### Day 6: October 12, 2022 Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Learning more about pooling, models, and Neural Networks to finish up freecodecamp Machine Learning with Python certification

**Thoughts** This is alot more complicated when trying to add it to my projects.


### Day 7: October 13, 2022 Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Still Learning Neural Networks, Deep Learning,11to finish up freecodecamp Machine Learning with Python Certification.

**Thoughts** Trying to really understand the concepts and apply them is time consuming. Those extra math classes were for q-learning and other programming concepts that I took at  Davenport really helped. I slept with that book for months.    

### Day 8, 9, 10: October 14 - 16, 2022 Friday - Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Still Learning Neural Networks, Deep Learning, and Machine Learning.

**Thoughts** I had to take a break and play some games.  I missed my games and after relaxing I got a few ideas.  I am not going back to bad habits but I am going to have to change my sleep schedule a little if I want to keep this pace.  

### Day 11: October 17, 2022 Monday

**Today's Progress**: Still working on Python Rock Paper Scissors, Cat and Dog Image Classifier, Book Recommendation Engine using KNN, Linear Regression Health Costs Calculator, Neural Network SMS Text Classifier.

**Thoughts** I'm tired but I didn't drink any coffee, I am trying to limit the earl grey tea I drink, like the doctor told me but its cold too so its tough.
