# 100 Days Of Code - Social Media Log

### Day 1: October 7, 2022 Friday

Day 1: Today I updated my website with a section just for the #100-days-of-code stuff.  I also went through my projects, exercises, and task on Trello to see what I need to improve, learn, and create.  A few things I'm still working on are a new cluster on MongoDB for apps, boiler plates/starters, and templates so I don't get obsessed with the small snippets.
