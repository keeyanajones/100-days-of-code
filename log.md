# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: October 6, 2022 Thursday (Preparing)
**Today's Progress**: I updated my tools (VSCode and Github Desktop) and started planning what I wanted to learn or improve.  I followed and subscribed to the social media accounts related to the challenge.  I also decided on a format for the work to be displayed. I updated my discord server and looked at how others post progress.   

**Thoughts:** I created a task list, updated Trello, my schedule, and overall I feel excited and ready to get started.  I do feel like I am not really a noob because I code more than an hour daily but I only sync my changes once a month for my website. I am a little concerned about how this will turn out because unlike most, my aim is not to teach Python, get a million followers, or be a fancy doctor scientist of the computer. My aim is to do what I already do but share it to inspire people who are like me.

### Day 1: October 7, 2022 Friday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many projects, exercises, and task on my Trello I need to get done.

**Thoughts** I've fallen behind on my a few of my task, and I plan on combining task to get caught up on task and working on the challenge.  I need to sync my github everyday.
